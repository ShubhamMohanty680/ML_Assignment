    "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that groups data points into a hierarchy of clusters based on their similarity. It is different from other clustering techniques in that it does not require a prior specification of the number of clusters, and it produces a tree-like structure of nested clusters that can be visualized as a dendrogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of hierarchical clustering can be divided into two main types: agglomerative and divisive. Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as a separate cluster and then progressively merges the most similar pairs of clusters until all the data points belong to a single cluster. Divisive clustering, on the other hand, starts with all the data points in a single cluster and then progressively splits it into smaller clusters until each data point belongs to its own cluster.\n",

It can also use different linkage methods to determine how to merge or split clusters, such as single linkage, complete linkage, or average linkage."

    "- **Dendrogram:** A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that shows the hierarchy of clusters produced by the clustering algorithm. The number of clusters can be determined by selecting the level in the dendrogram where the largest vertical distance can be observed without crossing any horizontal lines. This level indicates the number of clusters that best separates the data.\n",

The WCSS measures the total distance between each data point and its cluster centroid. The optimal number of clusters is the point where the decrease in WCSS begins to level off, creating an \"elbow\" in the curve.\n",

The silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1, where a higher score indicates a better clustering solution. The optimal number of clusters is the one that maximizes the average silhouette score across all data points."
