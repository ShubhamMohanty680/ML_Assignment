    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical variables into numerical representations, but they differ in how they assign these numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category in a categorical variable based on its order or rank. For example, if we have a variable called \"education level\" with categories \"high school,\" \"college,\" and \"graduate school,\" we might assign the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively, based on the order of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, on the other hand, assigns a unique integer value to each category in a categorical variable without considering any order or rank.

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable in a supervised machine learning problem.

    "Group the categories of the categorical variable by their target mean.\n",
    "Order the categories in ascending or descending order based on their target mean.\n",
    "Assign a numerical value to each category based on the ordered sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can group the categories of \"occupation\" by their mean target value (i.e., the proportion of people who earn more than $50,000 per year for each category) as follows:\n",

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship between two random variables. It measures how changes in one variable correspond to changes in another variable. In other words, covariance indicates the degree to which two variables vary together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relationship assessment: Covariance helps determine whether two variables are positively or negatively related. A positive covariance suggests that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, while a negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Strength of association: Covariance provides a measure of the strength of the relationship between variables. Larger absolute covariance values indicate a stronger association between the variables, while smaller values suggest a weaker association.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Variable selection: Covariance is utilized in feature selection and variable reduction techniques. By examining the covariance matrix, researchers can identify variables that are highly correlated, which helps in selecting a subset of variables that are most relevant to the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Portfolio diversification: In finance, covariance is crucial for assessing the diversification benefits of combining different assets in a portfolio. Negative or low covariance between assets suggests that they are less likely to move in the same direction, which reduces overall portfolio risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cov(X, Y) = Σ[(Xᵢ - X̄)(Yᵢ - Ȳ)] / (n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- Cov(X, Y) represents the covariance between variables X and Y.\n",
    "- Xᵢ and Yᵢ are the individual observations of variables X and Y.\n",
    "- X̄ and Ȳ are the means (averages) of X and Y, respectively.\n",
    "- n is the number of observations in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula calculates the sum of the products of the differences between each observation and its respective mean for both variables. The sum is then divided by (n - 1), where n is the number of observations. The denominator adjustment accounts for the sample nature of the data, providing an unbiased estimate of the population covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of the covariance alone doesn't provide a standardized measure of the strength of the relationship. To obtain a standardized measure, one can use the correlation coefficient, which is calculated by dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables."
