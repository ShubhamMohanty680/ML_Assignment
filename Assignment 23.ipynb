    "In the context of predicting house prices, RMSE is a more suitable metric to use as it provides an interpretable measure of the average error in dollars. This is particularly important because the goal is to predict house prices accurately, and RMSE provides an intuitive understanding of how well the model is performing in that respect.\n",

    "Another useful metric for regression problems is R-squared, which measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. However, in the case of SVM regression, where the model is optimized for minimizing the error, RMSE is more commonly used."

On the other hand, MAE measures the absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values, and is therefore less sensitive to outliers.\n",

    "The reason for this is that RMSE is more interpretable since it is expressed in the same units as the target variable. In the case of predicting house prices, RMSE would be expressed in dollars, which makes it easier to understand how well the model is performing in terms of its predictive accuracy.\n",

    "Additionally, RMSE is less sensitive to the scale of the target variable than MSE. This means that even if the scale of the target variable changes, the RMSE values would still be comparable across different models.\n",
