    "Feature selection is an important aspect of anomaly detection as it helps to identify the most relevant and informative features that can distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior in a dataset. The goal of feature selection is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by selecting a subset of features that are most relevant for detecting anomalies, while discarding irrelevant or redundant features.\n",

    "Feature selection is particularly important in anomaly detection because anomalies often manifest themselves as subtle deviations from normal behavior, which may be difficult to detect using all available features. By selecting the most relevant features, anomaly detection algorithms can focus on the key aspects of the data that are most indicative of anomalies, while ignoring irrelevant or noisy information."

    "2. **False Positive Rate (FPR):** FPR measures the proportion of normal data points that are incorrectly identified as anomalies by the algorithm. It is calculated as FPR = FP / (FP + TN), where FP is the number of false positives and TN is the number of true negatives.\n",
    "3. **Precision:** Precision measures the proportion of identified anomalies that are actually anomalies. It is calculated as Precision = TP / (TP + FP).\n",

The higher the AUROC score, the better the algorithm is at distinguishing between normal and anomalous data.\n",

Similarly, a larger value of min_samples may be appropriate for detecting more dense and well-defined clusters, while a smaller value may be appropriate for detecting sparser clusters or anomalies that are not part of any cluster. It is important to note that the optimal values of these parameters depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the types of anomalies being detected, and may require some experimentation or tuning."
