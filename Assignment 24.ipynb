    "1. **Medical diagnosis:** In medicine, Bayes' theorem can be used to calculate the probability of a patient having a disease given their symptoms and other medical information. Doctors can use this information to make more informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment.\n",

For example, the probability of rolling a six on a die given that the die has already been rolled is a conditional probability.

There are three types of Naive Bayes classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

Here are some guidelines to help you choose the appropriate type of Naive Bayes classifier:\n",
