    "A projection is a mathematical operation that involves mapping data points from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space. In the context of principal component analysis (PCA), a projection is used to transform a dataset from its original high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space that captures the most important information in the data.\n",

    "PCA is a technique used for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining the most important information in the data. It involves finding a new set of orthogonal basis vectors, called principal components, that capture the most variance in the data. These principal components are then used to project the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace.\n",

This results in a new set of values, which can be used to represent the data in a lower-dimensional space. By selecting the top k principal components with the highest variance, we can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data to k dimensions while retaining the most important information."
