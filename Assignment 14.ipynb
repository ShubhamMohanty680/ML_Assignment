    "4. Fit an Elastic Net Regression model: Fit an Elastic Net Regression model to your training set. This will give you coefficients for each of the input features.\n",
    "5. Analyze the coefficients: Analyze the coefficients to see which features have the most impact on your target variable. Features with higher coefficients are considered more important.\n",
    "6. Select the features: Select the top features based on the coefficients and build a new model using only those features.\n",
    "7. Evaluate the new model: Evaluate the performance of the new model on the testing set. If the performance is better than the original model, then the selected features are good predictors for the target variable."

Pickling is a convenient and efficient way to save and reuse a trained machine learning model, especially in situations where retraining the model each time it is needed is time-consuming or resource-intensive."
