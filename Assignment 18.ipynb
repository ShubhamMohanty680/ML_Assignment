Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all predicted positives, while recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives. High precision indicates a low rate of false positives, while high recall indicates a low rate of false negatives."

Specifically, the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall,  and is calculated as 2 * ((precision * recall)/(precision+recall)). The F1 score is often used in binary classification problems, whereas precision and recall are metrics that focus on either the positive or negative class separately.\n",

Precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall focuses on the ability to capture all positive instances. The F1 score combines these two aspects, giving equal importance to precision and recall and providing a balanced evaluation of the model's performance."

Multiclass classification refers to the classification of instances into more than two classes, whereas binary classification deals with only two classes. In multiclass classification, metrics such as accuracy, macro-averaged F1-score, or confusion matrix can be used to evaluate the model's performance."
